simtriplets
============
A FreeRADIUS python module that reads the simtriplets database.  It is intended
to replace the ``rlm_sim_files`` native module, which reads in the simtriplets
file and responds to authorization requests.

The main difference is that the native module only reads in 3 triplet records
for a given IMSI, whereas simtriplets.py reads in the entire "database" at the
start and randomly selects 3 for every authorization.


FreeRADIUS Configuration
--------------------------
You will need to add the following module file ``modules/simtriplets`` into the
configuration directory (usually ``/etc/raddb/``. It just tells FreeRADIUS
which Python module and functions to use.

Unfortunately, FreeRADIUS python modules cannot accept configuration
parameters, so the path to the ``simtriplets`` file is hardcoded into the
module itself.  You will need to instantiate the ``simtriplets`` module in the
``authorize`` section like so:

    authorize {
        ...

        simtriplets
    }

If you need to debug the module, run ``radius -X`` for full debugging output.
The module emits very little INFO messages during normal operation - just
enough to verify that it is working correctly.

Note that if you get a permission error, check that the simtriplets file can
be opened by FreeRADIUS, and if SELinux is enabled, make sure the file context 
is correct. You can use ``ls -Z`` to show the SELinux contexts.


simtriplets File Format
------------------------
The file should contain one record per line, separated by commas. The fields
should be (in the following order): IMSI, RAND, SRES and Kc.

Note that the IMSI need not be prefixed as this module only supports EAP-SIM
authentication.
